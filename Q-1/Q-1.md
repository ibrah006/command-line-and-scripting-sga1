echo command writes the specified text inside the single quotes to the file user_info.txt

4.

The output says:
this file has 1 line of content, 4 words and 37 characters

5. 
command:
```bash
man mkdir
```

Useful option: -p
```bash
mkdir -p main_folder/sub_folder/sub_folder1
```

Creates the directories (main_folder, sub_fodler and sub_folder1), each nested inside of its former directory
Adding this option won't throw an error if the directory already exists

The ```ls``` command itself displays contents of working directory in an alphabatical order

First, we create log.txt and add some sample text in it
```bash
echo "this is the admin file. this is a sample admin log file." >> log.txt
```
Search in log.txt
```bash
grep "admin" log.txt
```

uname -r
