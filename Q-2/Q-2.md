```ls``` command: specifying the option ```-l``` and the file name outputs the file's permissions

`-` indicates it's a regular file

`rw-`: owner has read and write permissions

`rw-`: group has read and write permissions

`r--`: others ave read only permissions

`1`: this indicates the number of hard links to the file

then the next two columns display the owner username and group name for the file, respectively

`96`: 96 bytes of data

`Jan 1 10:57`: Last modification date time

```bash
cp plan.txt plan_copy.txt
```
