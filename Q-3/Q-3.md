Creating symbolic links are done in the same way as hard links except we add the option `-s` to let the command line know we're actually creating a symbolic link

4. 
command:
```bash
ls -i sample_data.txt sample_hard.txt sample_soft.txt
```
![alt text](image-3.png)
534464 is the inode number of sample_data.txt

sample_hard.txt has the inode number of the original file as it's a hard link

532836 is the inode number of sample_data.txt
